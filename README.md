Frame Generator
===============

The Frame Generator, created in collaboration with KB Fellow Joris van Eijnatten, is a tool for extracting topics, the most relevant keywords and words related to those keywords (forming so-called frames) from a collection of sample texts provided by the user. In addition to the command line interface offered here, a graphical user interface is available at https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator-gui.
